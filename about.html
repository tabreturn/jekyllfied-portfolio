  Welcome to the portfolio website of Tristan Bunn.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tristan kicked-off his web design career back in the days of PlayStation 1, 
  grunge music, and dial-up modems. Since then he's worked on a diverse range 
  of cutting-edge digital projects including web campaigns for clients such as 
  Samsung, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz; and more recently has been involved in 
  various Cape Town based tech startups.
  </p>
  <p>
  He's developed into an accomplished coder and designer -- obtaining a BTech 
  in Graphic Design and Masters degree in Information Technology, in the 
  process -- and is currently involved in lecturing, research, and front-end 
  development work.
