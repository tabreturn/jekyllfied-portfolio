  Welcome to tabreturn.com -- a web portfolio of Tristan Bunn's work.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tristan kicked-off his web design career back in the days of PlayStation 1,
  grunge music, and dial-up modems. Since then he's worked on a diverse range
  of digital projects including web campaigns for clients such as Samsung, BMW,
  and Mercedes-Benz; more recently, he spent some time in the tech startup 
  space.
  </p>
  <p>
  Along the way he's developed into an accomplished coder and designer --
  obtaining degrees in design and computer science -- and is currently involved
  in lecturing, research, and work that blends code, interaction, interface
  design, and creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
  He currently resides in Wellington, New Zealand. You can contact him via
  email:<br />
