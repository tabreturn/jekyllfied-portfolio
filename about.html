  Welcome to the portfolio webiste of Tristan Bunn: coder/designer/lecturer
  </p>
  <p>
  I began my web design career back in the days of PlayStation 1, grunge music, 
  and dial-up modems. Since then I've worked on a diverse range of cutting-edge 
  digital projects including web campaigns for clients such as Samsung, BMW, 
  and Mercedes-Benz; and more recently have been involved invarious Cape Town 
  based tech startups. I hold a BTech in Graphic Design and will shortly be 
  completing my Masters degree in Information Technology.

  <p>
  Through my proffesional career, I've developed into an accomplished coder and 
  designer, and am currently involved in lecturing, research, and front-end 
  development work.
