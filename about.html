  Welcome to tabreturn.com -- a web portfolio of Tristan Bunn's work.
  </p>
  <p>
  Tristan kicked-off his web design career back in the days of PlayStation 1, 
  grunge music, and dial-up modems. Since then he's worked on a diverse range 
  of cutting-edge digital projects including web campaigns for clients such as 
  Samsung, BMW, and Mercedes-Benz; and more recently has been involved in 
  various Cape Town based tech startups.
  </p>
  <p>
  Along the way he's developed into an accomplished coder and designer --
  obtaining a BTech in Graphic Design and a Masters degree in Information
  Technology in the process -- and is currently involved in lecturing,
  research, and front-end development work.
  </p>
  <p>
  He currently resides in Wellington, New Zealand. You can contact him via
